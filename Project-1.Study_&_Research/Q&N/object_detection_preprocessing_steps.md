# Data Preprocessing for Object Detection

## 1. Data Collection
- Collect high-quality, annotated datasets.
- Sources include public datasets (COCO, Pascal VOC, OpenImages) or custom-labeled data using tools like LabelImg.
- Ensure annotations are in proper formats such as JSON (COCO) or XML (Pascal VOC).

## 2. Data Preprocessing
### 2.1 Normalization
Normalize pixel values to improve model convergence:
  - Formula: `I_normalized = (I - μ) / σ`, where `I` is the input pixel intensity, `μ` is the mean, and `σ` is the standard deviation.

### 2.2 Resizing
- Resize images and bounding boxes to match model input dimensions (e.g., 416x416 for YOLO).
- Adjust bounding box coordinates proportionally.

### 2.3 Augmentation
Apply transformations to enhance data variability:
- **Geometric**: Flipping, cropping, rotating.
- **Color**: Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation.
- **Noise**: Add Gaussian noise.
- Example: Horizontal flip requires adjusting bounding box coordinates.

### 2.4 Data Balancing
Balance classes to avoid model bias:
- Oversample underrepresented classes.
- Use class-weighted loss functions.

### 2.5 Annotation Validation
Validate annotations to ensure bounding boxes are correctly labeled and do not exceed image boundaries.

## 3. Data Input Pipeline
Efficiently handle large datasets using frameworks like TensorFlow Data API or PyTorch DataLoader. Implement hardware acceleration for preprocessing.

## 4. Splitting the Dataset
- **Training Set (~70–80%)**: Model training.
- **Validation Set (~10–15%)**: Hyperparameter tuning.
- **Test Set (~10–15%)**: Final evaluation.

## 5. Handling Class Imbalance
Address class imbalance by using techniques like focal loss or data resampling.

## 6. Defining the Object Detection Pipeline
1. **Step 1**: Data Input.
2. **Step 2**: Preprocessing.
3. **Step 3**: Model Training.
4. **Step 4**: Evaluation.

Metrics: mAP (Mean Average Precision), Precision, Recall.

## Example: Resizing Bounding Boxes
Given an image of size `800x600` resized to `416x416`, bounding box `(200, 150, 400, 300)`:
- `x_min' = (200/800) * 416 = 104, x_max' = (400/800) * 416 = 208`
- `y_min' = (150/600) * 416 = 104, y_max' = (300/600) * 416 = 208`
- Resized bounding box: `(104, 104, 208, 208)`.

###### Thanks to the owner who made the following code. I don't owe it. I just edited it to use for my datasets

## YOLO-darknet needs label files in '.txt' format.
Edit required parameters and run convert.py to get '.txt' file from '.xml'file

```
python3 convert.py

```

## Similarly YOLO needs train and test images in 'train.txt' and 'test.txt' format.
Change the parameters and run the code: 

```
python3 split.py

```
